**Eight Ball - Chat App**

**Assignment:**

Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

Itâ€™s a page that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp).

**Requirements:**

[+] - On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.

[+] - The screen should automatically flow and follow the messages posted, like in all chat apps.

[+] - Each message should have an indication of the date and time it was sent.

[+] - Your CSS needs to be clean.

[+] - Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript.

[+] - Use jQuery to interact with the DOM.


**Design:**

Based on the assignment above, I decided to take a little creative license and turn it into a magic eight ball,
with graphics displaying the response, right before the response is also posted, into the chat flow. Since the
responses from the computer are to be auto generated, it seemed to make sense to stick to YES/NO questions and
use the classic magic eight ball responses.
